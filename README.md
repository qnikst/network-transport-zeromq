network-transport-zeromq
========================

[![Build Status][Build Status Image]][Build Status]

network-transport-zmq provides
a [network-transport][network-transport] implementation based on the
Ã˜MQ brokerless message passing system.

Currently all network-transport tests are passing, however
distributed-process-tests that use monitoring and connection break
do not.

Features:
--------

    [+] Plain-text authorization
    [+] Reliable connections
    [+] Multicast
    [+] Manual connection break

### Plain text authorization

It's possible to add default user and password for all transport
connection by setting authorization ZMQParameters
```haskell
defaultZMQParameters {authorizationType=ZMQAuthPlain "user" "password"}
```

### Reliable connections

n-t-zmq uses Push-Pull pattern to implement reliable connections.

### Multicast protocol

n-t-zmq provide multicast group based on Pub Sub protocol, this
protocol is semi reliable, i.e. all messages will be delivered if they
will not reach High Water Mark event in presence of disconnects.

### Manual connection break

0mq automatically reconnects when connection is down and resend
messages so no message will be lost, however this may break some user
assumptions thus it's possible to mark.
